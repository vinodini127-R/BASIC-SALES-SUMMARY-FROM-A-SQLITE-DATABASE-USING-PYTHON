##  PROJECT OVERVIEW

IT CONNECTS TO AN SQLITE DATABASE, CALCULATES **TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD** AND **TOTAL REVENUE** FOR EACH PRODUCT,  
AND VISUALIZES THE RESULTS WITH A **BAR CHART**.

##  DATASET DETAILS
**DATASET NAME:** ONLINE SALES DATA  
**SOURCE:** PROVIDED CSV FILE  
**DATABASE:** SQLITE (`SALES_DATA.DB`)  
**TABLE NAME:** `SALES`

**COLUMNS USED:**

- UNITS SOLD  
- UNIT PRICE  
- TOTAL REVENUE   

### STEPS USED IN THE PROJECT
 PREPARE THE DATA
PLACE THE ONLINE SALES DATA.CSV FILE IN YOUR WORKING FOLDER
 
IMPORT CSV INTO SQLITE
CREATE AN SQL DATABASE FILE (SALES_DATA.DB).
IMPORT THE CSV DATA INTO A TABLE NAMED SALES.

CONNECT TO DATABASE
OPEN A CONNECTION TO SALES_DATA.DB  IN PYTHON.

RUN SQL QUERY
SELECT PRODUCT NAME, TOTAL UNITS SOLD, AND TOTAL REVENUE.
GROUP RESULTS BY PRODUCT AND SORT BY REVENUE IN DESCENIDNG ORDER

LOAD RESULTS INTO PANDAS
STORE QUERY RRESULTS IN A DATAFRAME FOR EASY ANALYSIS.

VISUALIZE DATA
CREATE A BAR CHART SHOWING  REVENUE BY PRODUCT.
SAVE THE CHART AS  A PNG FILE.

BUSINESS INSIGHTS
PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER TOTAL REVENUE ARE THE MOST PROFITABLE AND SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED IN MARKETING CAMPAIGNS.
LOW-REVENUE PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS, PROMOTIONS, OR STOCK REDUCTION.
