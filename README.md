# BASIC-SALES-SUMMARY-FROM-A-SQLITE-DATABASE-USING-PYTHON

##  PROJECT OVERVIEW
THIS PROJECT ANALYZES **ONLINE SALES DATA** USING **SQLITE** AND **PYTHON** TO SUMMARIZE SALES PERFORMANCE.  
IT CONNECTS TO AN SQLITE DATABASE, CALCULATES **TOTAL QUANTITY SOLD** AND **TOTAL REVENUE** FOR EACH PRODUCT,  
AND VISUALIZES THE RESULTS WITH A **BAR CHART**.

##  DATASET DETAILS
**DATASET NAME:** ONLINE SALES DATA  
**SOURCE:** PROVIDED CSV FILE  
**DATABASE:** SQLITE (`SALES_DATA.DB`)  
**TABLE NAME:** `SALES`

**COLUMNS USED:**
- TRANSACTION ID  
- PRODUCT CATEGORY  
- PRODUCT NAME  
- UNITS SOLD  
- UNIT PRICE  
- TOTAL REVENUE   

### STEPS USED IN THE PROJECT

 PREPARE THE DATA:

 PLACE THE ONLINE SALES DATA.CSV FILE IN YOUR WORKING FOLDER
 
IMPORT CSV INTO SQLITE:

CREATE AN SQL DATABASE FILE (SALES_DATA.DB).
IMPORT THE CSV DATA INTO A TABLE NAMED SALES.

CONNECT TO DATABASE:

OPEN A CONNECTION TO SALES_DATA.DB  IN PYTHON.

RUN SQL QUERY:

SELECT PRODUCT NAME, TOTAL UNITS SOLD, AND TOTAL REVENUE.
GROUP RESULTS BY PRODUCT AND SORT BY REVENUE IN DESCENIDNG ORDER

LOAD RESULTS INTO PANDAS:

STORE QUERY RRESULTS IN A DATAFRAME FOR EASY ANALYSIS.

VISUALIZE DATA:

CREATE A BAR CHART SHOWING  REVENUE BY PRODUCT.
SAVE THE CHART AS  A PNG FILE.

BUSINESS INSIGHTS:

PRODUCTS WITH HIGHER TOTAL REVENUE ARE THE MOST PROFITABLE AND SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED IN MARKETING CAMPAIGNS.
LOW-REVENUE PRODUCTS MAY REQUIRE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS, PROMOTIONS, OR STOCK REDUCTION.
